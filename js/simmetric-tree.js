/*
Symmetric Tree
Have the function SymmetricTree(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, 
which will represent a binary tree, and determine if the tree is symmetric (a mirror image of itself). 
The array will be implemented similar to how a binary heap is implemented, 
except the tree may not be complete and NULL nodes on any level of the tree will be represented with a #. 
For example: if strArr is ["1", "2", "2", "3", "#", "#", "3"] then this tree looks like the following:

      1
  2      2
3   #  #   3


For the input above, your program should return the string true because the binary tree is symmetric.
Examples

Input: ["4", "3", "4"]
Output: false

Input: ["10", "2", "2", "#", "1", "1", "#"]
Output: true

  return strArr;
}

console.log(SymmetricTree(["4", "3", "4"]));
console.log(SymmetricTree(["10", "2", "2", "#", "1", "1", "#"]));
